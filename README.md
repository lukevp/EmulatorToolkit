# EmulatorToolkit
Develop, Debug, and Test Computer and Video Game Emulators with Ease!

Emulator Toolkit provides an API layer in all supported languages that you implement in your emulator.  It takes 5 minutes to add to your project, and will allow breakpoints, stepwise debugging, disassembly, and a full test harness to be available immediately.  This makes the process of developing and testing your emulator much easier at the beginning!

The purpose of Emulator Toolkit is to provide a reference implementation of each opcode of a target emulator, and validate that your emulator functions identically to the reference implementation.  It does this by measuring all side-effects of the state of your system (via hooks into your RAM and Registers) to ensure every component of an opcode is implemented properly.
